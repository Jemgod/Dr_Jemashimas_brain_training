**The brain training app of your past is back and with less that ever!!**

Here is a little project as part of my 1st marked Uni project that requried a bunch of googling to figure out the bits and bobs...

If you run the file called *Dr_Jemashima's_brain_trianing_flask.py* you should be able to connect to the test html page http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Please give it a try and let me know your thoughts!
Many Thanks,
Jem
